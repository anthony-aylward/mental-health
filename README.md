# Graduate School and Mental Health

There is an growing discussion of mental health in the academic community.
Of particular concern is the mounting quantity of anectodal reports and
empirical data that point to a crisis of mental health problems among graduate
students. Here is an illustrative (but not exhaustive) selection of news &
opinion articles to this effect:

- [The Emotional Toll of Graduate School](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/) (2019)

## A mental health crisis in graduate education

Several of the above articles reference published academic studies of mental
health among graduate students that have been carried out over the past few
years. They include:

- [U.C. Berkeley Graduate Student Happiness & Well-Being Report | 2014](http://ga.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wellbeingreport_2014.pdf)
- [Work organization and mental health problems in PhD students](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733317300422)
- [Evidence for a mental health crisis in graduate education](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089)
- [Graduate Student Mental Health: Lessons from American Economics Departments](https://scholar.harvard.edu/bolotnyy/publications/graduate-student-mental-health-lessons-american-economics-departments)

All of these studies reach the same conclusion: Graduate students suffer from
disproportionately high rates of mental illness, this problem is a severe
drain on their productivity and well-being, and it demands immediate policy
intervention.

## Mental health and grad exprience statistics at UCSD

While anecdotal and imperical evidence do indicate severe mental health problems
among graduate students as a whole, there is high variability in student
experiences among different universities, departments, and programs. It is
important that we also consider statistics collected from UCSD that are
relevant to the BISB program as much as possible.
